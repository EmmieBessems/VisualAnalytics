           "International Times Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas<br>Industry   2 October 1982  The world of gas is distant,<br>difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I<br>journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to<br>look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the<br>sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas<br>company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and<br>the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.<br>As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a<br>vivid example of how a once small exploration company from<br>Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force<br>in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the<br>encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the<br>first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the<br>man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of<br>the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the<br>whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from<br>it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum<br>interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just<br>a story of new energy. Something very significant has<br>happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas<br>industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital<br>city there are important lessons for other places blessed<br>(and cursed) with abundant natural resources. Centrum<br>developed world class expertise in engineering in very<br>difficult surroundings When I was a young newspaperman on<br>the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great<br>off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then<br>seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal<br>into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed<br>to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city<br>of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots,<br>starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. Much to his<br>mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started<br>prospecting in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, a new<br>gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.<br>Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major<br>supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much<br>further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates<br>in numerous countries.  The change in Centrum has been<br>substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of<br>helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the<br>planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back<br>and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum,<br>almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of<br>GAStech.  Sanjorge has recently started paying more<br>attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing<br>his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the<br>company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a<br>report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways<br>of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for<br>decades to come. The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so<br>keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more<br>clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate<br>removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  So<br>thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people<br>who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place<br>where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has<br>taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and<br>turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual<br>property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise<br>long after the gas itself runs out."

The centrum developed the<br>expertise of class of the world while machinant in very<br>difficult environments  When I was a young journalist on the<br>daily disc in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies,<br>great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea.

It<br>seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the<br>vast city of the centrum, Tethys obtained with a little<br>large for its initializations, starting to believe in new<br>industry of imagination.  Much with the regrets of his/her<br>mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the<br>prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.  With the<br>beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech,<br>began the sound truck-like advances.  Under its careful<br>councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier<br>of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with<br>far.

You<br>note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-<br>ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had<br>aligned them with the airport of the city to make the<br>shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.  And<br>while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is<br>financed by a division of GAStech.   Sanjorge recently<br>started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures<br>and philanthropy, allowing its Jr. and hank Fluss de wire<br>Sten of cofounder to direct the company.

The gas of the schalie is<br>obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic<br>substrate disposal which involves injecting zuurrijke the<br>layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them<br>omhoog and within aardgas locked up it rather to give.<br>Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and<br>oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy<br>market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow,<br>occupy with opposition of government and local communities.<br>Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or<br>are possible the zeeschaliegas become geëxploiteerdt.  A lot<br>of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate<br>disposal can mariene damage themselves environments, and the<br>avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But<br>boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult<br>negotiations with local Councils, communities and<br>landowners.  Based on existing geological data, SanJorge<br>that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place -<br>until 100 triljoen cubic foot are, which would be more than<br>the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is<br>also the possibility of finding oil.  GAStech that has<br>valued Kronos the total sea resources of the schaliegas<br>between five 10 times the size of resources available coast<br>could be.    We are very comfortable that the means is there<br>and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid<br>SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is<br>invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in<br>the answer.  Although it has become only recently<br>controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been<br>used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional<br>oil and gasputten to the flow of. But using the process on<br>the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas<br>has been commercially never done.  Professor Oskar Wertz van<br>Universiteit Tethys is sceptical concerning or to the<br>zeeschaliegas a large employee to European energy in the<br>next decade could be, but will say that potentially was<br>possible in the longer term have.  GAStech are optimistic<br>are its estimates of how long it will last to examine<br>zeeschalie. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40<br>years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the<br>technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which<br>we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed<br>that this the really large industry could be. The task in<br>the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work<br>they."

The exploration has proven an<br>controversial edition in Kronos>>  To continue reading main<br>history   The son of the founder of the company/signature of<br>the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate<br>inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned.  Sten<br>Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas<br>coast outside that could be extracted.  Sanjorge and GAStech<br>were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos<br>the month last through the ministry of the energy and the<br>development and hopes to begin the exploration soon.  The<br>gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there<br>is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the<br>development coast outside that we cannot develop to these<br>resources coast outside, he said the times.  The gas of the<br>slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the<br>hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies<br>injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to<br>break them for above and sending the catched natural gas<br>inside.  The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has<br>produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of<br>the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But<br>the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded<br>with the opposition of the government and local communities.<br>Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the<br>substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the<br>extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But<br>perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the<br>difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities<br>and landholders.  In agreement with existing geologic data,<br>SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the<br>place - up to 100 cubical feet trillón, that would be more<br>than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial<br>resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.<br>GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of<br>the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between<br>five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one<br>of the resources.    We are that the resource is there and<br>the numbers are absolutely ginormous, said very comfortable<br>SanJorge.  Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is<br>billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to<br>invest in the answer.  Although it has gotten to be only<br>recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the<br>substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many<br>years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the<br>oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed<br>wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never<br>has been made commercially.  Professor Oskar Wertz of the<br>university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast<br>outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the<br>European energy in the next decade, but says that he could<br>have potential in the one of more long term.  GAStech is<br>being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to<br>explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable<br>that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the<br>retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the<br>way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we<br>will have so advanced that this could be a really great<br>industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these<br>things towards outside, considers if they work."

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend<br>of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of<br>Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.<br>Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents<br>will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides<br>nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I<br>received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the<br>editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper<br>serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he<br>described a once bountiful region now distressed by<br>contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening<br>problem.  I decided to investigate. We didn't make the<br>connection at first, Reese told me when I met with him at<br>his office.  The gas company had been built a few years back<br>in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a<br>couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We<br>thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get<br>better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a<br>harder look at what could have changed. The change turned<br>out to be GAStech International, an international<br>corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out<br>of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation<br>began as a family-owned business providing local trucking<br>services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and<br>Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative,<br>and thus began a series of environmental disasters and<br>financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an<br>early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own<br>company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the<br>helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its<br>influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep<br>of the small peaceful township of Elodis. With a population<br>of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story<br>houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in<br>the township along a main street with two markets, two<br>hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can<br>buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to<br>bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.<br>We've made a good living for a long time, Reese tells me.<br>The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop<br>production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't<br>left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural<br>places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed.<br>There was a future for them here. I asked Reese to help me<br>meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's<br>operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had<br>been here for several generations.   I caught up with Henk<br>Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware<br>store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed<br>soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their<br>fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm. Part Two<br>will be published April 25, 1998"

With the death<br>of Sr of Sanjorge, the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in<br>his catch and widened his influence further with far,<br>thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small<br>peaceful black suburbs of Elodis.  With a population of<br>6500, the majority of the residents of Elodis live in houses<br>one and of two-history to small farms.

I<br>caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at<br>Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi<br>has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and<br>their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.<br>We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years,<br>maybe a bit more, Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a<br>container of bolts, searching for the right size.  Over the<br>years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps<br>us busy. Busy is an understatement, as I found when I<br>prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. I usually head to<br>the fields before sun up, Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My wife<br>gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a<br>little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside<br>me until dinner.  When the children get home from school<br>they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most<br>times by dark. We do this most days, he adds, except for<br>worship days. Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and<br>chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes<br>his purchase. We all know one another here, Bodrogi explains<br>as we leave. Most families have lived here for generations.<br>The first new people that came to town were with that gas<br>company that built a few years back. I ask Bodrogi if<br>business has been good.  We were doing pretty good until<br>recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade<br>equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the<br>crops. In what way, I asked. The crops aren't producing like<br>they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then<br>one of the city officers figured out to call in a water<br>specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was<br>contaminated. Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look<br>in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had<br>to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they<br>could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him<br>climb into his truck and head out of town. The water<br>specialist turned out to be the international agency<br>Wellness For All, an international agency with a mission to<br>bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural<br>disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas<br>development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness<br>for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project<br>coordinator for Wellness for All.  She spoke to me over a<br>satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where<br>she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake.<br>Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between<br>meetings about their work in Elodis. We were contacted by a<br>city official about a problem they were having with their<br>local water.  In the last few years agriculture had<br>foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth<br>defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the<br>Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we<br>looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of<br>production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.<br>Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene<br>arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins.  Can these<br>substances occur naturally? I asked her. Not in these<br>amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination<br>is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes<br>are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are<br>forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River<br>from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water<br>and irrigation for the crops. Did you talk to GAStech about<br>this? Oh yes, she replied.  At first we believed we were<br>gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech<br>representatives, including one of the senior executives,<br>Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act<br>responsibly to provide material and financial assistance<br>toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became<br>clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who<br>makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has<br>no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or<br>the environment. Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his<br>share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed<br>a reputation for cutthroat business practices. When we<br>didn't make headway with GAStech, Reynolds continued, the<br>community leaders decided to approach the government of<br>Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission<br>from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in<br>an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then<br>approached the government officials as citizens of a<br>Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our<br>agency assured them we would again be available to help in<br>any way when those agreements were finalized. At this point<br>Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to<br>my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story. Part<br>Three will be published May 15, 1998"

The Elodis<br>leaders then approached the government officials as citizens<br>of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis."

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in<br>the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the<br>hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.

My wife obtains the ascending cabritos<br>and title to teach, then she will do a little something so<br>that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until<br>supper.  When the children obtain school caretakers make<br>their tasks, and we are all buttocks in the house most of<br>the times by darkness.  We do this most of the days, he we<br>added, with the exception of days of the adoration.  Bodrogi<br>identifies the appropriate bolt and to char it with the<br>teller on cabritos and school whereas it finishes his<br>purchase.  All we know one another one here, Bodrogi we<br>explained whereas we go away. Most of the families they have<br>lived here for the generations.  The first new people who<br>came to the city were with that company of the gas that<br>constructed the posteriora part of some years.  I request<br>Bodrogi if the business has been good.   We made quite good<br>recently until time.  The benefits were good and added<br>cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began<br>to have all this hardship with the harvests.  How, I it<br>requested.  The harvests are not producing as they have in<br>the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then<br>one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside<br>calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it<br>they said that the water was contaminated.  Bodrodgi sighed,<br>and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by<br>my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back<br>home.    I thanked for it I watched and to raise it in its<br>car and head outside city.  The specialist of the water<br>turned out to be the international agency health for all, an<br>international agency with a mission to bring the healthy<br>water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters,<br>sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.<br>I took for above with a representative of the health for all<br>the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the<br>project for the health for all.  She spoke to me on a call<br>based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia<br>South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevación of the<br>creation which they followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds<br>decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on<br>its work in Elodis.  A civil employee of the city on a<br>problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with<br>its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had<br>collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects<br>of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from<br>the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we<br>looked for a source against the current.  We above find<br>sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km><br>of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests<br>demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno,<br>arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other<br>toxins.   These substances Can happen naturally I asked to<br>him.  Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The<br>contamination of the underground water is generally the<br>result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are<br>sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are<br>forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele<br>of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable<br>water and irrigation for the harvests.  You spoke with<br>GAStech on this  Oh yes, she answered.  We thought at the<br>outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times<br>with the representatives of GAStech, including one of the<br>senior executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us<br>that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and<br>financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a<br>time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was<br>serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is<br>evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the<br>well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere.<br>Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the<br>company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation<br>for the practices of business of cutthroat.  When we did not<br>make progress with GAStech, Reynolds continued, the leaders<br>of the community decided to approach the government of<br>Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the<br>permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test<br>resultses in an official public document.  The leaders of<br>then Elodis approached the officials of the government like<br>citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the<br>scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we<br>would be again available to help anyway when those<br>agreements were concluded.

When they examined<br>it they said that water was soiled.

The water specialist proved to be<br>the international agency health for all, an international<br>agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the<br>communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and -<br>coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.

It spoke to me above a satellite call<br>its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of<br>relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs.<br>Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between<br>the meetings about their work in Elodis.  We were contacted<br>by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had<br>with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was<br>effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects<br>of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes<br>from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the<br>leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources<br>of provision of reject of production to the <km> of<br>operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high<br>levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and<br>selenium, between other toxins.    Can these substances<br>occur naturally? I asked him.  Not in these amounts, and not<br>this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually<br>the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech<br>discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form<br>a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river<br>of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis<br>their drinking water and irrigation for harvests.  You spoke<br>in GAStech on this subject?  The OH yes, it answered.  In<br>the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met<br>several times with representatives of GAStech, including one<br>of the senior executive, Fluss hank.  It personally ensured<br>us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to<br>the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of<br>cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly<br>that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes<br>the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not<br>have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of<br>Elodis, or environment.  Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had<br>inherited its share to the company of his/her father in<br>1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of<br>management.  When we did not make progress with GAStech,<br>Reynolds continued, the chiefs of the community decided to<br>approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.

I have requested that he says to me on the<br>implication of the government of Kronos in the deeply<br>worrisome account of the fight of a community for the<br>protection against which they must help them more: its<br>chosen civil employees, against whom they would poison his<br>children and the food of the country.  It took from long<br>term so that any person responds, Reese says to me of its<br>fight.  Henk Bodrogi - the man who you satisfied - did not<br>give for above.  It called each department that could<br>possibly be associated to our problem:  outer interior,<br>justice, subjects, health.    Henk and some other residents<br>made several trips to Abila that tried to be able somebody<br>to listen.  Finally, a comprehensive person of the ministry<br>of the health answered the door, so that is where we began.<br>Then Reese describes months of the meetings in which the<br>officials of the government demanded the documents that<br>proved their case:  statistic of the health and the harvest,<br>the scientific test resultses of the health for all, and<br>medical files.  It has been frustrating.  We bring the<br>documents that wish, and then they wish to confirm the<br>results, or they say to us to provide the additional<br>information or to have closed meetings of the door.  We are<br>at the moment in course of negotiation of a date for a<br>hearing in the ministry of the health to present/display our<br>request for the aid.   Has been worthy of her?  You say to<br>me, the pitchings of Reese towards outside his window.  I<br>watch on its shoulder to see a group of children who strike<br>a ball of soccer with the foot in the dust.  What option we<br>have"

Yesterday the morning of June 19,<br>a small group of defenders of POK collected in front of the<br>police station of Abila, holding of the photographs of<br>Elian, and another young martyrdom, Juliana Vann, ten years<br>- the old maid who died in 1998 of cancer caused by benzene<br>toxins in her drinking water.    Both died because of the<br>lies of government and the corruption, a man indicated to me<br>who asked that its named either retained because of the<br>preoccupations with a revenge of police force.  Juliana died<br>because Kronos made it possible GAStech to poison our water,<br>and dead Elian because it tried to bring the justice of<br>Juliana.  When it finishes?  Others, a larger crowd had<br>collected the front day in park close to city to bring the<br>public conscience about these same questions.  Among the<br>speeches and the music, I heard the same message of the year<br>before:  To remember Juliana! To remember Elian!"

           "International Times Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of<br>Designer Drug Users  7 February 2013 The Emergency<br>Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been<br>swamped in the last month by people suffering medical<br>complications from designer drugs such as cotton candy and<br>synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. We have had<br>at least two dozen cases in the last month, said Alicia<br>Bianca, nurse manager of the department. We are literally<br>overwhelmed. Bianca said she has never seen this level of<br>activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she<br>has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she<br>has been a nurse. Authorities in Abila said cotton candy may<br>have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter,<br>whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a<br>dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports<br>to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several<br>deaths have been attributed to Cotton Candy according to the<br>Kronos National Poison Center. Patients are coming to Abila<br>General from throughout the greater city region, and they<br>include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-<br>economic backgrounds, Bianca said. Sgt Antonio Arresta of<br>the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency<br>medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen<br>a spike in the number of people needing treatment for<br>complications from designer drugs. We went from zero calls<br>to a handful of calls in the last month, he said. Bianca and<br>Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more<br>difficult because they often do not know anything about the<br>designer drugs that were taken. You don't know what you're<br>getting when you get it, Bianca said. We have had patients<br>come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They<br>tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic<br>marijuana. Bianca said there is little clinical data on the<br>effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant.<br>There are no controlled studies in toxicology, she said. The<br>national poison center collects anecdotal reports on<br>overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of<br>efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer<br>drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the<br>active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy<br>mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently<br>change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name<br>to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. It is<br>another way to sell it, she said. The term cotton candy, for<br>example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do<br>with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the<br>name of Spice Dreams one week and under the name of Tulip<br>Blossom the next.  The Kronos government has placed three of<br>the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy<br>on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use<br>and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban<br>cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and<br>skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as<br>herbal therapy products and are available over the counter<br>in area stores. We still don't know what you are getting<br>with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from<br>package to package, Bianca said. One factor for the<br>popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She<br>said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of<br>cocaine costs K166. Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a<br>high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but<br>also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's<br>ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to<br>the point where they consume the drug for days. They crave<br>it, she said. After repeated use, the drug fries a person's<br>brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations.<br>This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior<br>that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the<br>naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of<br>a major highway, Bianca said. The seizures and delusions are<br>incredible, she said. While it is not yet certain who is<br>behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs,<br>police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income<br>source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been<br>involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and<br>enforcement agencies are closely examining possible<br>cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and<br>political insurgent groups."

According to Danisliau, the<br>seven or eight passengers of the first plane were business<br>types and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly<br>clear where they were headed. The plane took off around<br>12:30 local Kronos time.   The second plane also carried<br>seven or eight business types, but seemed much more relaxed<br>than the first group of passengers. Danisliau said the<br>second group of passengers seemed to be celebrating<br>something. The second plane departed around 14:30 around two<br>hours after the first plane.  Danisliau confirmed that the<br>second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.  Between the two<br>private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to<br>sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily<br>account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos.   When asked<br>whether or not the two planes had anything to do with<br>GAStech International Danisliau replied, I don't ask a lot<br>questions. I just fuel the planes."

Fluss, has worked with<br>dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has<br>humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in<br>Tethys.   He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a<br>leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can<br>hope in the market.   Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for<br>when it comes to Kronos?  A: The economic atmosphere has<br>changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful<br>today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its<br>expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The<br>foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are<br>resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds<br>of the population.  But there is less difference than people<br>think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of<br>Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly<br>like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he<br>himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate<br>to the efficient communication and a talented leader.  What<br>foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate<br>the way of Kronosian and to take time to understand its<br>personnel.  Q:  Can you elaborate?  A: There are many<br>cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the<br>notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when<br>somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple<br>answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer<br>that it does not answer its initial question.  The people of<br>Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare<br>it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being<br>forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign<br>necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need<br>to take the time to understand how to communicate.  The<br>patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to<br>obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians<br>is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can<br>make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more<br>pleasant experience.  Q:  Which is the challenges of the<br>pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?<br>A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be<br>desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power<br>to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being<br>able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In<br>Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull<br>in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition<br>but on a daily base is very annoying.  Another one is<br>becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are<br>working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of<br>the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers<br>of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work<br>or how they are described are. This can be confused.     Q:<br>Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can<br>prepare yourself?  A: The first thing that would say is to<br>prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to<br>the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life.<br>The family and the work who mix themselves are practical<br>very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours<br>and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from<br>Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the<br>family.  Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is<br>the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to<br>be successful -- often much more that in its countries of<br>origin. The language is a great edition.  [But] does not<br>concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of<br>the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to<br>him.  Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign<br>CEO in Kronos?  A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is<br>hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is<br>resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its<br>personal life.  When an equipment of hears them to Kronos<br>that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem.<br>But, cultural they do not have an edition with the<br>foreigners.   Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign<br>executive being is really an advantage?  A: This question<br>really depends on the person and how much they invest to<br>understand the country and the culture. If they do not<br>deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But<br>in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury<br>merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can<br>bring another point of view, facilitate the process.  The<br>foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can<br>sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can<br>be true assets."

           "  World Journal  The perspicacity of an expert: prosperity<br>as foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos   2014/03/26 January 17, 1995<br>The Fluss hank is PRESIDENT de GAStech, the principal<br>industry of Krono during more than 15 years, after its<br>discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of<br>Elodis.  Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents<br>during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and<br>oil prospector in Tethys.   It spoke at times about the<br>features about a chief successful in Kronos and which<br>foreign Presidents can envisage in the market.   Q: What the<br>foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?<br>A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It<br>is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign<br>Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no<br>easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and<br>foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the<br>hearts and the spirits of the population.  But there is less<br>of difference than people think between the culture of<br>Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of<br>Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their<br>work and have the same desire for success. They can also<br>appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.<br>Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate<br>the manner of Kronosian and to take time to<br>include/understand their personnel.  Q: Can you work out?<br>A: There are many cultural differences while communicating.<br>[To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always<br>confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody<br>in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of<br>that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer<br>their initial question.  The people of Kronos do not like to<br>take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their<br>work and do not like to be forced in saying something which<br>they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take<br>account of this and have to take time to include/understand<br>how to communicate.  Patience is key. Transparency can be an<br>excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European<br>value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a<br>company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President<br>into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.  Q: What the<br>challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they<br>face on the arrival in Kronos?    A: Sometimes in fact the<br>simplest things can be most provocative, like obtaining from<br>A with B in a taxi. To be able to obtain around easily is<br>taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a<br>great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never<br>sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address<br>envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is<br>very tiring.  Another ends up knowing your team and with<br>which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in<br>addition to plane and in an office completely of the<br>colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they<br>are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be<br>muddling.   The Presidents must take time to speak with<br>their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of<br>truck and to include/understand their new environment before<br>they test them and control.  Q: Can you give some ends on<br>the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?  A: the<br>first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They<br>can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of<br>operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and<br>the work of mixture are practical very current here. The<br>people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their<br>colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is<br>a clear border between work and the family.  The foreign<br>Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and<br>how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often<br>much more than in their countries of origin. The language is<br>a great question.  [But] anyhow much prepare you, the true<br>experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always<br>astonish you.  Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be<br>a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?  A: Generally, I think that<br>being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the<br>environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance<br>with your personal life.  When a team of Kronos hears them<br>that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a<br>problem. But, culturelement they do not have a question with<br>foreigners.   Q: Are there situations in which to be a<br>foreign director is really an advantage?  A: This question<br>really depends on the person and how much they invest to<br>include/understand the country and the culture. If they do<br>not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in<br>certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods<br>of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They<br>can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.<br>Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of<br>an industry and can bring the access to the markets of<br>overseas. This can be a tangible asset."

Fluss, have worked with<br>dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However,<br>he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys.<br>He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a<br>successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the<br>market can expect.   Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when<br>they to Kronos expects come?  A: The economic environment<br>has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more<br>with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize<br>expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The<br>competition under Kronosian and foreign firma's is tough. It<br>is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the<br>population.  But there is less difference than people<br>between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian.<br>The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful<br>of their work and has same the wish for success. They know<br>also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a<br>gifted LEADER.  What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how<br>at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand<br>to understand their staff.  Q: Can you develop?  A: There<br>are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think]<br>after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and<br>frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in<br>Kronos] and simple ja/nee expect answer. In place of it they<br>become a very long answer to that their initial question<br>does not answer.  People of Kronos love the no<br>responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their<br>job and do not love in saying something are forced they to<br>wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time<br>to have demand to understand how at to communicate.<br>Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent<br>get manner around this. It is a European value that<br>Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can<br>turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant<br>experience.  Q: What are the most important challenges<br>foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?    A:<br>Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge,<br>such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be<br>easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large<br>meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as<br>your driver you on the planned address sale. This is<br>possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it<br>is very tiring.  Another get to know your team and which you<br>work with. Frequently foreign CEOs staprecht of the plane<br>and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea<br>that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This<br>can be confusing.   The need of CEOs demand the time to<br>speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck<br>drivers and their new environment to understand before they<br>try and them lead.  Q: Can you give a couple ends on how<br>foreign CEO can preparations make?  A: The first thing which<br>I am your prepare family would say. They can find it<br>difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can<br>influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is<br>here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime<br>and socialiseren with their colleagues it is very differing<br>from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work<br>and family.  Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are<br>the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to<br>succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country.<br>The language is a large question.  [But] no question how<br>much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to<br>work and live you always.  Q: How difficult - or easy - is<br>it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?  A: Generally, think I<br>am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment<br>tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal<br>life.  When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from<br>overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no<br>question with aliens.

A:<br>This question depends really on the person and how much they<br>invest to understand the country and culture. If they make<br>no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in<br>certain negotiations or certain questions such as<br>luxegoederen, foreign CEOs can be an advantage.

The leader of a<br>forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a<br>brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into<br>the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing<br>dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government,<br>he started driving the POK into an action-based<br>organization, instead of one waiting for their government to<br>make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana<br>Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses<br>attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's<br>industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and<br>thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in<br>front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday<br>while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses<br>comment on the circumstances of his death. Rather<br>charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw<br>attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could<br>also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after<br>GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist<br>group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, Sanjorge is a<br>brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a<br>ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food<br>prices in Abila are really high.

In Tethys a few years ago, I<br>journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to<br>look at a contentious new energy producing area. One of the<br>sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas<br>company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and<br>the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.<br>As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a<br>vivid example of how a once small exploration company from<br>Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force<br>in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the<br>encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the<br>first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the<br>man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of<br>the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the<br>whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from<br>it. But as I went round the capital city of Centrum<br>interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just<br>a story of new energy. Something very significant has<br>happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas<br>industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital<br>city there are important lessons for other places blessed<br>(and cursed) with abundant natural resources. Centrum<br>developed world class expertise in engineering in very<br>difficult surroundings When I was a young newspaperman on<br>the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great<br>off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then<br>seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal<br>into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed<br>to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city<br>of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots,<br>starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. Much to his<br>mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started<br>prospecting in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, a new<br>gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.<br>Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major<br>supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much<br>further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates<br>in numerous countries.  The change in Centrum has been<br>substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of<br>helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the<br>planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back<br>and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum,<br>almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of<br>GAStech.  Sanjorge has recently started paying more<br>attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing<br>his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the<br>company.

The exploration has proven an<br>controversial edition in Kronos>>  To continue reading main<br>history   The son of the founder of the company/signature of<br>the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate<br>inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned.  Sten<br>Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas<br>coast outside that could be extracted.  Sanjorge and GAStech<br>were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos<br>the month last through the ministry of the energy and the<br>development and hopes to begin the exploration soon.  The<br>gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there<br>is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the<br>development coast outside that we cannot develop to these<br>resources coast outside, he said the times.  The gas of the<br>slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the<br>hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies<br>injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to<br>break them for above and sending the catched natural gas<br>inside.  The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has<br>produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of<br>the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But<br>the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded<br>with the opposition of the government and local communities.<br>Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the<br>substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the<br>extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But<br>perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the<br>difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities<br>and landholders.  In agreement with existing geologic data,<br>SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the<br>place - up to 100 cubical feet trill\\u00f3n, that would be more<br>than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial<br>resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.<br>GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of<br>the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between<br>five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one<br>of the resources.    We are that the resource is there and<br>the numbers are absolutely ginormous, said very comfortable<br>SanJorge.  Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is<br>billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to<br>invest in the answer.  Although it has gotten to be only<br>recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the<br>substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many<br>years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the<br>oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed<br>wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never<br>has been made commercially.  Professor Oskar Wertz of the<br>university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast<br>outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the<br>European energy in the next decade, but says that he could<br>have potential in the one of more long term.  GAStech is<br>being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to<br>explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable<br>that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the<br>retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the<br>way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we<br>will have so advanced that this could be a really great<br>industry.

Bouro.<br>Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents<br>will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides<br>nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I<br>received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the<br>editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper<br>serving the community around Tiskele Bend.

Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation<br>began as a family-owned business providing local trucking<br>services in Tethys.

Bodrogi<br>has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and<br>their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.<br>We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years,<br>maybe a bit more, Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a<br>container of bolts, searching for the right size.  Over the<br>years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps<br>us busy. Busy is an understatement, as I found when I<br>prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. I usually head to<br>the fields before sun up, Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My wife<br>gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a<br>little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside<br>me until dinner.  When the children get home from school<br>they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most<br>times by dark. We do this most days, he adds, except for<br>worship days. Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and<br>chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes<br>his purchase. We all know one another here, Bodrogi explains<br>as we leave. Most families have lived here for generations.<br>The first new people that came to town were with that gas<br>company that built a few years back. I ask Bodrogi if<br>business has been good.  We were doing pretty good until<br>recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade<br>equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the<br>crops. In what way, I asked. The crops aren't producing like<br>they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then<br>one of the city officers figured out to call in a water<br>specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was<br>contaminated. Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look<br>in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had<br>to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they<br>could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him<br>climb into his truck and head out of town. The water<br>specialist turned out to be the international agency<br>Wellness For All, an international agency with a mission to<br>bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural<br>disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas<br>development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness<br>for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project<br>coordinator for Wellness for All.  She spoke to me over a<br>satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where<br>she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake.<br>Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between<br>meetings about their work in Elodis. We were contacted by a<br>city official about a problem they were having with their<br>local water.  In the last few years agriculture had<br>foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth<br>defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the<br>Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we<br>looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of<br>production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.<br>Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene<br>arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins.  Can these<br>substances occur naturally? I asked her. Not in these<br>amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination<br>is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes<br>are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are<br>forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River<br>from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water<br>and irrigation for the crops. Did you talk to GAStech about<br>this? Oh yes, she replied.  At first we believed we were<br>gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech<br>representatives, including one of the senior executives,<br>Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act<br>responsibly to provide material and financial assistance<br>toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became<br>clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who<br>makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has<br>no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or<br>the environment. Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his<br>share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed<br>a reputation for cutthroat business practices. When we<br>didn't make headway with GAStech, Reynolds continued, the<br>community leaders decided to approach the government of<br>Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission<br>from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in<br>an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then<br>approached the government officials as citizens of a<br>Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our<br>agency assured them we would again be available to help in<br>any way when those agreements were finalized.

The leader of a<br>forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a<br>brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into<br>the spotlight of this island nation. Fueled by a growing<br>dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government,<br>he started driving the POK into an action-based<br>organization, instead of one waiting for their government to<br>make things aright. Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana<br>Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses<br>attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's<br>industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and<br>thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in<br>front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday<br>while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses<br>comment on the circumstances of his death. Rather<br>charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw<br>attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could<br>also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.
