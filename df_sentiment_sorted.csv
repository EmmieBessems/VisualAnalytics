We didn't make the connection at first, Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed. The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.

I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.  We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more, Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy. Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more. I usually head to the fields before sun up, Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark. We do this most days, he adds, except for worship days. Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase. We all know one another here, Bodrogi explains as we leave. Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back. I ask Bodrogi if business has been good.  We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops. In what way, I asked. The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated. Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The water specialist turned out to be the international agency Wellness For All, an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for Wellness for All.  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis. We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins.  Can these substances occur naturally? I asked her. Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops. Did you talk to GAStech about this? Oh yes, she replied.  At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment. Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices. When we didn't make headway with GAStech, Reynolds continued, the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized. At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins.   These substances Can happen naturally I asked to him.  Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.

We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month, said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. We are literally overwhelmed. Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse. Authorities in Abila said cotton candy may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to Cotton Candy according to the Kronos National Poison Center. Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said. Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. We went from zero calls to a handful of calls in the last month, he said. Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken. You don't know what you're getting when you get it, Bianca said. We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana. Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. There are no controlled studies in toxicology, she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. It is another way to sell it, she said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of Spice Dreams one week and under the name of Tulip Blossom the next.  The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as herbal therapy products and are available over the counter in area stores. We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package, Bianca said. One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. They crave it, she said. After repeated use, the drug fries a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. The seizures and delusions are incredible, she said. While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.

Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team.  He is optimistic that he can identify the source.  These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin, Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree.  This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names cotton candy, spice dreams and Tulip Blossom, was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.  I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army, Loblaw said.  Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation.  The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called Arise.  Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.

Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?  A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today.
